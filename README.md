# OpenCV
##### This repository contains projects based on computer vision such as face detection from image/video and motion detection using python's OpenCV library.
###### you can use another cascade xml file for creating face-cascade-classifier. NOTE: this project is created on Google's Colab notebook as it provides free GPU.

* OpenCV_FaceDetection.ipynb notebook contains code to detect faces in given frame.
* opencv_motion_detector.py file contains code to detect motion in live webcam and notify admin through email.

NOTE: Try to run above code in python IDE's like pycharm/spider because some functionalities of OpenCV may not work in notebooks like jupyter or google colab.
